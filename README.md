## ⚡ Automation for MySQL DBAs

> Automate repetitive tasks to increase efficiency and reduce errors.

- [ ] Shell Scripting for health checks and backups
- [ ] Python (using `mysql-connector`, `PyMySQL`, `sqlalchemy`)
- [ ] Ansible Playbooks for config management
- [ ] SaltStack / Chef / Puppet for infra as code
